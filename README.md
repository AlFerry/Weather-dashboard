# Weather-dashboard
A central hub to view the weather of multiple locations

When a user loads the webpage, they can search for a city to view the weather.

If they have already used the weather dashboard, they will be able to see previous searches and click on them to view the weather.

When they view the weather for a city, they will see the current temperature, weather condition, wind-speed, humidity, and UV Index.

The dashboard will also display a five-day forecast showing daily temperatures, weather condition, wind-speed, and humidity.

When a user resizes their browser window, the display will adjust to ensure forecasts are legible.

When a user views the site on a mobile device, the search menu will collapse to a hamburger menu, and the current/forecasted weather will all be shown in a column.
